# PYTHON-CERTIFICATION
Python is one of the most popular, flexible programming languages today. 
You can use it for everything from basic scripting to machine learning.
In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, We will learn Python 
fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. But most of 
those fundamentals were covered in python-projects repo (We will only write 
few files, then after we will much focus on complex data structure).
Then we will quickly ramp up to complex data structures, networking, 
relational databases, and data visualization.
The courses were created by Dr. Charles Severance (also known as Dr. Chuck). 
He is a Clinical Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information,
where he teaches various technology-oriented courses including programming, database design, and web development

Time to put your Python skills to the test.
By completing these projects
(Arithmetic Formatter, Time Calculator, Budget App, Polygon Area Calculator, Probability Calculator), 
I will demonstrate that I have a good foundational knowledge of Python and qualify for 
the Scientific Computing with Python Certification.
